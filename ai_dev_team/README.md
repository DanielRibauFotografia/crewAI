python src/ai_dev_team/main.py "Create a web application for..."
```

### Custom Workflow
```bash
python src/ai_dev_team/main.py --custom
```

### Environment Variables
Edit `.env` file to customize:
- `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL`: Default language model
- `CODE_LLM_MODEL`: Model for code-related tasks
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: Ollama server URL

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed project descriptions
2. **Include Context**: Mention target audience, scale, and constraints
3. **Specify Technology**: If you have preferences, include them
4. **Define Scope**: Clearly outline what you want to build
5. **Mention Requirements**: Include any specific requirements or constraints

## Example Project Descriptions

### Good Examples
- "Create a modern e-commerce web application with React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, supporting 10,000+ concurrent users, with features like product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, and admin dashboard."

- "Develop a mobile-first task management application using React Native, with offline support, real-time synchronization, team collaboration features, and integration with popular calendar applications."

### Avoid Vague Descriptions
- "Build an app"
- "Create a website"
- "Make something cool"

## Troubleshooting

### Ollama Issues
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check available models: `ollama list`
- Pull required models: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`

### Performance Tips
- Use smaller models for faster responses
- Limit the number of agents for simple projects
- Use custom workflows for specific needs

## Support
For issues and questions:
1. Check the examples in the `examples/` directory
2. Review the configuration in `.env` file
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Verify Ollama is running and models are available
