**Generated on:** 1753971073.4591444

## Analysis Result

**Brief Project Overview:** 
Creating a simple REST API for a todo application involves designing a scalable backend service that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks. The API should be built using modern technologies, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. A user-friendly interface will also be necessary to facilitate interaction with the API.

**Key Features Needed:**
• User registration and authentication
• Task creation, reading, updating, and deletion
• Search functionality for tasks by title or description
• Priority management (e.g., high, medium, low)
• Status tracking (e.g., completed, pending)

**Technology Stack Recommendation:** 
1. **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework for efficient routing and handling HTTP requests.
2. **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing task data in a structured manner.
3. **Frontend Framework:** React or Angular for building responsive user interfaces.

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up the project structure and install required packages using npm or yarn.
2. Implement authentication mechanisms, such as Passport.js for secure API access.
3. Design and implement the database schema to store task data efficiently.
